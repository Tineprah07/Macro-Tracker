Macro Tracker — Simple Daily Nutrition Log

I got tired of paid fitness apps and complicated trackers when I started going to the gym. Most of them required subscriptions, were overloaded with features I did not need, or made it difficult to quickly track my daily macro goals.

So I built this simple macro tracking tool for myself.

This app focuses on one thing only: making it fast and easy to log protein, carbohydrates, fats, and calories throughout the day.

Features

Track macros for Morning, Afternoon, and Evening

Daily totals calculated automatically

Visual progress rings and bars

Customisable macro goals

Status feedback showing whether you are on track

Dark / light theme toggle

Per-day tracking with date navigation

Data saved locally (no account required)

Copy daily summary to clipboard

Export all data as CSV

Works on desktop and mobile browsers

Why I Built This

When I began training, I needed a quick way to track my nutrition without:

Paying for premium apps

Creating accounts

Navigating complex food databases

Using slow interfaces

This tool removes all friction and lets me log numbers directly.

How It Works

All data is stored locally in your browser using local storage.
Nothing is uploaded or shared, so your data stays private.

Usage

Simply open the app in your browser and start entering your macros for each meal.
Navigate between dates to view or edit previous days.

No installation required.
