# Macro Tracker — Simple Daily Nutrition Log

I got tired of paid fitness apps and complicated trackers when I started going to the gym. Most of them required subscriptions, were overloaded with features I did not need, or made it difficult to quickly track my daily macro goals.

So I built this simple macro tracking tool for myself.

This app focuses on one thing only: making it fast and easy to log protein, carbohydrates, fats, and calories throughout the day.

## Why I Built This

When I began training, I needed a quick way to track my nutrition without:

- Paying for premium apps  
- Creating accounts  
- Navigating complex food databases  
- Using slow interfaces  

This tool removes all friction and lets me log numbers directly.

## How It Works

All data is stored locally in your browser using the Local Storage API.  
Nothing is uploaded or shared, so your data stays private.

---

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser  
2. Enter your macros for each meal  
3. Navigate between dates to view or edit previous days  

No installation required.
